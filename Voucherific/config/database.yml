# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,

# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.

# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
